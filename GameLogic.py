# Description : This class defines the logic of Minesweeper gameplay. This 
#               class allows the user to reveal cells and set flags, in addition
#               to describing winning and losing conditions of the game. The
#               user wins if all the cells are opened, all the suspected mines
#               are flagged, and no mines are opened.
